Here, notes from some C++ Interview Questions and suggested answers from a pdf resource by written by InterviewBit.


What do you mean by abstraction in C++?

Abstraction is the process of showing the essential details to the user and hiding the details which we donâ€™t want to show to the user or hiding the details which are irrelevant to a particular user.

What is an abstract class and when do you use it?

A class is called an abstract class whose objects can never be created. Such a class exists as a parent for the derived classes. We can make a class abstract by placing a pure virtual function in the class.
