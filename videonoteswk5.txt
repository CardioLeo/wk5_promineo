object oriented programming

video 1

JavaScript

traditionally a functional programming language, until ECMA6/ES6

made Object Oriented Programming accessible in JavaScript

objects is how we already think of things in human thinking

properties; [philosophical] attributes;

let objects = ( attributes + functionality );

---

4 pillars of object oriented programming:


1 Abstraction

Abstraction example: motion; a vehicle moves; all vehicles move;

2 encapsulation 

hides details of how it works; driving a car, hides the data about how the car works; this suggests

3 inheritance

abstraction, animal; inherits communication; 

4 polymorphism

animals all inherit communication, but communication is polymorphic because communication can be barks, chirps, or human speech, just as examples.

using classes;

video 2

classes video;

grouping attributes and functionality together; variables and methods; "student"

a class that represents a student

//coding examples begin here; camel case for most conventions; Pascal case is used for classes; Student (?I think?)

A.

class student {
	constructor() {
		this.firstName = "Sam";
		this.lastName = "Smith";
		this.phoneNumber = "4805555555";
		this.grade = "A";
	}

}

B.

class student {
	constructor(firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, grade) {
		this.firstName = "Sam";
		this.lastName = "Smith";
		this.phoneNumber = "4805555555";
		this.grade = "A";
	}
}

C.

class student {
	constructor(firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, grade) {
}
}
