[class notes] Abstraction "generalize the implementation details" espresso vs drip vs keurig they can all make() cofee. Expose only what you need. "We don't really know how a car works unless we like cars and learn about it. We just put the gas in and go.] It's going to abstract away the details of how something works." [doesn't care how it works, only so long as it works for the desired goal/purpose.]

encapsulation -- concepts change in different contexts. and so encapsulation meant different things in the 90s. before websites, phones, watches, and fridges had applications on them, encapsulation had a different context, though still related to OOP.

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance [extension?]
4. Polymorphism

inheritance, applied taxonomy; vehicles; wheeled vehicles; classification of animals.

helps reuse and share code.

why reinvent the wheel. keep basic functionality already written out.

Instructor Stepanski is not sure that Polymorphism can be used in JavaScript [I did find a link on Polymorphism in JS: https://linuxhint.com/javascript-polymorphism/#:~:text=Polymorphism%20in%20JavaScript%20refers%20to,object%20can%20have%20different%20behavior.]

OOP

Classes:

allows us to structure our code:
-"class is a "blueprint""
-"Object is an instance or implementation of the blueprint"
-"The blueprint is used to create an object."
-"One blueprint can make an //infinite// number of objects."

Object:
the actual thing created by a class; object is instance of class; you can create an object without having a class first, but it is harder to create more of the same if you only have an object.

never a property without a value; property must have some value; even if null.

property is "a key-value pair."

A. --dot-references
object.propertyname => no spaces in key name; has to be exact property name

B. --bracket-reference
object["propertyname"] => why use this syntax?

(1), B will work if you have a space in the property, though shouldn't be a space; this is also if you know the property you are trying to reach, by name.

(2), B is a way to reach via variable without necessarily knowing the specific name of the property; say you need to loop through it? can use i, as in looping iterations. if you don't know the names of the properties you can do this
