try block
catch block

catch block catches errors from try block

list.push('hello');
console.log('goodbye');

when run, goodbye never gets logged because the error is thrown trying to get pushed to an array that doesn't exist. error, exception thrown.

So how do we get the program to continue even if error.

Try and Catch blocks.

try {
	list.push('hello');
	console.log('goodbye');
} catch(err) {
	console.log(err)
}

/// or

try {
	list.push('hello');
} catch (err) {
	console.log(err);
}

console.log('goodbye');

finally block runs whether there is an error thrown or not.

finally {}

this is for handling exceptions for libraries outside of our code, outside of our control;
